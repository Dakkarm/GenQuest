      "content": "What is the scientific explanation behind the changing of colors in a chameleon's skin, and which animal shares this ability?",
      "answer": "A chameleon changes its skin color through the use of specialized cells called chromatophores, which contain pigments. By expanding or contracting these cells, a chameleon can alter its color. Cuttlefish also share this ability, and they can change their color and pattern in a matter of seconds for camouflage and communication."
